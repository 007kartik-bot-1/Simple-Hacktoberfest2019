1. It should first state the purpose of the program. For eg if I'm creating a program to print the    prime nos in a range. Then you should mention at the beginning of the file by commenting it out.

2. Don't add too basic programs like addition of two numbers or hello world.

3. Follow the above set pattern while making PRs otherwise it won't be accepted.
